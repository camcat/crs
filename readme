Dependencies
------------

CRS has been written for and tested on Linux.
It depends on the following:

gcc (C compiler)
mpicc (MPI compiler, for running MPI code)
openMP libraries
GNU scientific libraries (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)

some functionalities require the Numerical Recipes (source code in C). http://www.nr.com/

The code was tested with gcc version 4.4.0.


Installation
------------

The following steps are needed to install CRS:

1. Install the GNU Scientific Libraries (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
   The compiler expects the libraries to be located /usr/local/lib, and the source code at /usr/local/include/gsl/

2. Set up paths to the numerical recipes source code in the script scripts/config_numrec.sh (more details in the script itself), and run it.
   If you don't plan to use spline interpolation for continuous stresses, you can skip this step.

3. Configure makefiles for compiling serial or parallel(mpi) version by running the script switch_compiler.sh.
   For the serial version, type: scripts/switch_compiler.sh mpicc2gcc (choose the option if you are not running CRS on a cluster)
   For the MPI version, type: switch_compiler.sh gcc2mpicc
   By default, the makefiles are configured to compile the serial version of the code.
   You will need to run this script again to compile a different version of the code (serial/parallel) in the future.

4. Compile the code:
    cd Release
    make clean
    make all
    cd ..

  This will create file run_crs or run_mpi_crs, depending on whether you are compiling the serial or parallel version. 


Running the program
-------------------

1. Serial version:   

	Release/run_crs [options] name_of_input_file

   [options] are one of the following:
	-v --verbose: more output will be printed on the screen, including the name of each function producing output.
	-q, --quiet: screen messages are suppressed.


2. MPI version:

	mpirun -n N Release/run_mpi_crs [options] name_of_input_file

   where N is the desired no. of ranks.


CRS can be tested by running: 

	Release/run_crs tutorial/input/input.txt 

and checking that the output (tutorial/output/) is the same as the folder tutorial/output_reference.



Additional documentation
------------------------

The formats of the input files and output files are described in doc/inputformats.readme and doc/outputformats.readme
Template input files are provided in the folders: 
	doc/examples-simple: simplified templates to generate a forecast using only slip models as sources and without inverting for optimal rate-state parameters.
	doc/examples/: detailed templates with explaination of every available option.

The folder: tutorial/ contains input and output files for a tutorial described in the file tutoria/tutorial.pdf
