#This is a simplified version of the parameter file, set up to generate a forecast without inverting rate-state parameters and resolving stresses on faults with a fixed orientation. See doc/examples/example_InputModelParametersFile.txt for the full documentation.

#       Coulomb stress parameters             #
#=============================================#
# 1. [not used] Msource, extra_dist: Minimum magnitude of events to be used as stress sources; extra distance oudside model domain for which sources should be included (both horizontal/vertical distance, km). Note that events with a slip model will be used regardless of their magnitude and location.
# 2. [not used] source_mode_focmec (iso/fm), source_mode_nofocmec (no/iso/fix). Not used if only slip models are used to calculate stresses.
# 3. [not used] fm_res: Resolution (patch length, km) of the synthetic slip models created from focal mechanisms.
# 4. DCFS_min, DCFS_cap (Pa):
#    DCFS_min is the smallest Coulomb stress change which should be computed (used to select a subset of grid points for each source and reduce calculations).
#    DCFS_cap: values of Coulomb stress change with absolute exceeding DCFS_cap will be capped to DCFS_cap (to avoid singularities in Okada solutions).
# 5. [not used] res_xy, res_z: minimum internal horizontal/vertical model resolution.

#          Rate-State Parameters              #
#=============================================#
# Section controling Rate-and-State parameters (Asigma, ta, r0).
#
# 1. LLinversion: Flag indicating if inversion for RS parameters should be performed. Here we set it to 0. In this case, fixr0, fixAsig, fixta must be set to 1 below. 
# 2. fixr0, [r0]: fixr is a flag indicating if r0 should be inverted for; if set to 0, it should be followed by the default value of r0 = daily rate of earthquakes in the domain.
# 3. fixAsig, Asig0. Asig0 is the default value. Units=Pa.
# 4. fixta, ta0. ta0 is the default value. Unit=days.
# 5. [not used] Mc: min. magnitude of events to be used for LogLikelihood calculations. 
# 6. [not used] Controls the time windows to be excluded from the LogLikelihood calculation due to incomplete catalog.

#       Treatment of Uncertainties            #
#=============================================#
# This section controls the treatment of uncertainties in the Coulomb stress field.
# 1. Receiver fault orientation and flag indicating if rake should be optimal.
#    options: oops (optimally oriented planes), fixed (uses the uniform reginal field plane given below, or planes from the gridded file given by "FixedMecFile" in the input file), focmec (uses the planes from the focal mechanisms catalog, performing Monte Carlo iterations over the available mechanisms). 
#    If "fixed" or "focmec" are chosen, the next parameter on the same line is a flag indicating whether the rake should be optimized. If set to 1, the program will calculate the rake which gives the largest total stress; otherwise, it will use a fixed rake.
# 2. grid_error (0/1): flag indicating if the error due to finite grid size should be calculated.
# 3. [not used] Nsur: number of Monte Carlo iterations.

#=============================================#
#
# 1. output_forecast, dt: flag indicating if forecast should be produced; time step used for output of seismicity temporal evolution (days).
# 2-5. [not used] Expected difference between the ZMAP earthquake catalog (InputCatalogFile) and the catalog of focal mechanisms (InputCatalogFocMecFile): these values are used as tolerance when associating focal mechanisms to the ZMAP events.
# 6. [not used] smoothing: minimum smoothing distance used for calculating background rate from a catalog (if parameter InputBackgroundRateCatalog is used).

#===========================================================#
# 1. Elastic paremeters: lambda, mu (MPa)
# 2. Friction coefficient, Skepton coefficient
# 3. Uniform regional field description:	strike, dip, rake
#    This is used as receiver fault if you selected "fixed" above, and if no gridded file with focal mechanisms ("FixedMecFile" in input file) is provided.
#    It is also used to calculate the orientation of the background stress field if the option "oops" is selected below.
# 4+. [not used] Choice between "paxis" and "oops", two ways in which the regional stress field can be described: 
# if "paxis", the following 3 lines give amplitude (MPa), strike, dip of the principal axis:
#	5. 	sigma1	strike1	dip1
#	6.	sigma2	strike2	dip2
#	7. 	sigma3	strike3	dip3
# if "oops", the following lines give the amplitudes of the principal axis (MPa). The orientation of the axis will be calculated assuming that the regional fault mechanism is optimally oriented according to the Coulomb failure criterion.
