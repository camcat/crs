#       Coulomb stress parameters             #
#=============================================#
#
# 1. Msource, extra_dist: Minimum magnitude of events to be used as stress sources; extra distance oudside model domain for which sources should be included (both horizontal/vertical distance, km). Note that events with a slip model will be used regardless of their magnitude and location.
#    If a spatially variable background rate r0(x) is estimated from a catalog, Msource is also used as minimum mainshock magnitude for declustering the catalog.
# 2. source_mode_focmec (iso/fm), source_mode_nofocmec (no/iso/fix):
#    source_mode_focmed controls how sources with a known focal mechanisms are treated: as isotropic sources (iso) or with synthetic slip models from the focal mechanisms (fm).
#    source_mode_nofocmec controls how sources without a known focal mechanism are treated: ignored (no), as isotropic sources (iso), with synthetic slip models from the uniform regional mechanism (fix).
#	note: if source_mode_focmec=iso, source_mode_nofocmec will also automatically be set to "iso" (since there is no distinction between the two event types).
# 3. fm_res: Resolution (patch length, km) of the synthetic slip models created from focal mechanisms. If the resolution is small enough that a multiple-patch model is created, this model will be tapered on each side (instead of simply uniform slip).
# 4. DCFS_min, DCFS_cap (Pa):
#    DCFS_min is the smallest Coulomb stress change which should be computed (used to select a subset of grid points for each source and reduce calculations).
#    DCFS_cap: values of Coulomb stress change with absolute exceeding DCFS_cap will be capped to DCFS_cap (to avoid singularities in Okada solutions).
# 5. res_xy, res_z: minimum internal horizontal/vertical model resolution. Will be ignored if larger than the cell size in the ForecastTemplate file.

#          Rate-State Parameters              #
#=============================================#
# Section controling the inversion of Rate-and-State parameters (Asigma, ta, r0).
# The inversion is based on maximizing the LogLikelihood, using a simple a grid search algorithm. 
# For details, see Hainzl et al. (2009), Appendix A1.
#
# 1. LLinversion: Flag indicating if inversion for RS parameters should be performed.
#    If LLinversion is set to 0, the following three lines should indicate the default values of rate and state parameters (and fixX=0 will be ignored).
# 2. fixr0, [r0]: fixr is a flag indicating if r0 should be inverted for; if set to 0, it should be followed by the default value of r0.
#    r0 is the daily rate of earthquakes in the domain; if a non-homogeneous background rate is used, the rate in each cell is normalized to give total rate r0.
# 3. This line has two possible forms (without commas):
#	fixAsig, Asig0:	is fixAsig=1 or LLinversion=0, Asig0 is the default value [this option should be used if LLinversion=0]. Unit=Pa.
#	fixAsig, Asig_min, Asig_max, nAsig, Asig_stepmode: if fixAsig=0, Asig_(min/max) the lower/upper bound of Asig, and nAsig the number of values to be tested.
#    	Asig_step_mode is one of: lin/log, and determines whether the steps between Asig_(min/max) will be linear or logarithmic.
# 4. This line has two possible forms:
#       fixta, ta0: is fixta=1 or LLinversion=0, ta0 is the default value [this option should be used if LLinversion=0]. Unit=days.
#       fixta, ta_min, ta_max, nta, ta_stepmode: if fixta=0, the ta_(min/max) are the lower/upper bound of ta, and the nta number of values to be tested.
#    ta_step_mode is one of: lin/log, and determines whether the steps between Asig_(min/max) will be linear or logarithmic.
#	fixAsig, Asig_min, Asig_max, nAsig: if fixAsig=1, Asig_(min/max) the lower/upper bound of Asig, and nAsig the number of values to be tested.
# 5. Mc: min. magnitude of events to be used for LogLikelihood calculations. 
#       if Mc>20, the program will estimate the catalog completeness magnitude.
# 6. Controls the time windows to be excluded from the LogLikelihood calculation due to incomplete catalog.
#    tw, Magmain: tw=length of time window to skip (days); Magmain= min. magnitude of mainshocks following which a time window should be skipped;
#    If no time should be skipped, set Mag_main to a large value (setting Mag_main to a small value and tw=0.0 leads to longer computation times).

#       Treatment of Uncertainties            #
#=============================================#
# This section controls the treatment of uncertainties in the Coulomb stress field.
# For a description of each type uncertainty is treated, see Cattania et al. (2014).
# 1. Receiver fault orientation and flag indicating if rake should be optimal.
#    options: oops (optimally oriented planes), fixed (uses the uniform reginal field plane given below, or planes from the gridded file given by "FixedMecFile" in the input file), focmec (uses the planes from the focal mechanisms catalog, performing Monte Carlo iterations over the available mechanisms). 
#    If "fixed" or "focmec" are chosen, the next parameter on the same line is a flag indicating whether the rake should be optimized. If set to 1, the program will calculate the rake which gives the largest total stress; otherwise, it will use a fixed rake.
# NOTE: There are some caveats for using of OOPS or optimal rake with aseismic stresses: see file TODO.
# 2. grid_error (0/1): flag indicating if the error due to finite grid size should be calculated.
# 3. Nsur: number of Monte Carlo iterations.

#             Other parameters                #
#=============================================#
#
# 1. output_forecast, dt: flag indicating if forecast should be produced; time step used for output of seismicity temporal evolution (days).
# 2-5. Expected difference between the ZMAP earthquake catalog (InputCatalogFile) and the catalog of focal mechanisms (InputCatalogFocMecFile): these values are used as tolerance when associating focal mechanisms to the ZMAP events.
# 2. dt: time tolerance (days)
# 3. dMag: magnitude tolerance
# 4. dxy: horizontal distance tolerance (km)
# 5. dz: vertical distance tolerance (km)
#
# 6. smoothing: minimum smoothing distance used for calculating background rate from a catalog (if parameter InputBackgroundRateCatalog is used).

#===========================================================#
# 1. Elastic paremeters: lambda, mu (MPa)
# 2. Friction coefficient, Skepton coefficient
# 3. Uniform regional field description:	strike, dip, rake
#    This is used as receiver fault if you selected "fixed" above, and if no gridded file with focal mechanisms ("FixedMecFile" in input file) is provided.
#    It is also used to calculate the orientation of the background stress field if the option "oops" is selected below.
# 4+. Choice between "paxis" and "oops", two ways in which the regional stress field can be described: 
# if "paxis", the following 3 lines give amplitude (MPa), strike, dip of the principal axis:
#	5. 	sigma1	strike1	dip1
#	6.	sigma2	strike2	dip2
#	7. 	sigma3	strike3	dip3
# if "oops", the following lines give the amplitudes of the principal axis (MPa). The orientation of the axis will be calculated assuming that
# the regional fault mechanism is optimally oriented according to the Coulomb failure criterion.
